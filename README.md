# EmpowerHerHub

# Inspiration
According to the American Society for Training and Development, 75% of executives have reported mentorship being essential to their career and personal development. Inspired by Nuzhat's keynote, and drawing from personal experiences, we know that job searching and personal development can be difficult enough for anyone, especially for college-aged women and gender minorities who are just starting their careers and also for those who are older and looking to re-enter the workforce. EmpowerHer Mentorship bridges the age gap and alleviates imposter syndrome for women and gender minorities, providing a safe, inclusive web experience to find woman-to-woman mentorship in career, wellness, and finance.

# What it does
The platform acts as a universal hub, facilitating connections between mentors and mentees for mentorship purposes. It offers a user-friendly interface for users to connect, seek mentorship, and explore job opportunities tailored to their skills and interests.
Additionally, Figma wireframes aid in prototyping our website, showcasing recommended jobs, and offering mentorship across various categories such as employment, wellness, and finance.

# What's next for EmpowerHer 
In future iterations of EmpowerHer, we'd like to add more career planning features such as daily career milestone tasks, and build out the community tab with short articles, course suggestions, woman-friendly financing/trading suggestions, and videos related to career, wellness, and financial success. Following WiCHacks, our goal is to advance the website beyond the prototype stage using React or Angular for front-end, relational database and Java or Python as our backend, necessitating a learning curve for these frameworks to enhance interactions. Additionally, we intend to enhance the inclusivity of our mentorship program.
